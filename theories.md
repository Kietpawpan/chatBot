# City Sinking Theory 
Let A is a city where the land is 1.5 m above mean sea level (MSL). The city will be sinked by seawater if the mean sea level increases 1.5 m, or after the volume of raising water in the global ocean (v) is equal to or greater than the global ocean's surface area (O) multiplied by 0.0015 km.

We know that
1. The global ocean's surface area is 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>
