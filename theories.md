A Theory of Sinking City 

Let A is a city where the land is 1.5 meters above mean sea level (MSL), and hence remains the Earth's crust above mean sea level. The city will be sinked by seawater if the mean sea level will have increased by 1.5 m, or after the rising volume of water in the global ocean (v) will have been equal to or greater than the global ocean's surface area (O) multiplied by 0.0015 km.

We know that the global or world ocean's surface area is 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>. So, the city will be sinked after V >= 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>* 0.0015 km, or 0.541695 million km<sup>3</sup>. This ocean water might be from the melting of the two polar ice caps of Earth: Antarctic ice sheet and Artic ice sheet.

Antartic ice sheet covers about 98% of the Antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on Earth, with the average thickness of over 2 km covering an area of almost 14 million km<sup>2</sup>. Its ice volume is 2 km * 14 million km<sup>2</sup>, or 28 mllion km<sup>2</sup>. If the whole mass of the ice sheet is melt, the water mass will be densed by 9%, so the water volume melt from the ice sheet is 28 million km<sup>3</sup> * 0.91, or 25.48 million km<sup>3</sup>, which can increase the mean sea level by 25.48 million km<sup>3</sup>/361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>, or 0.0705 km, or 70.55 m, greater than others' estimate (58 meters of sea level rise if all the ice were above sea level).
