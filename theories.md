# A Theory of Sinking City

Let A is city in the coastal lowland, with with an average elevation of 1.5 metres above mean sea level (MSL). The city can be sinked by seawater if the sea level increases by greater than 1.5 meters, or after the rising volume of water in the global ocean (v) is greater than the global ocean's surface area (O) multiplied by 0.0015 km.

```
function sinkingCity() {
var A = getElementById(A).value; // city MLS
var O = getElementById(O).value; // global ocean volume
var V = O * A / 1000; // max volume of sea level rise that can sink city A.
var seaLevelRise = getElementById(S).value;
let sinking = "";
if(seaLevelRise > V) {
sinking = "Sinked";}
else {sinking = "Not sinked";}

}
```


We know that the global or world ocean's surface area is 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>. So, the city will be sinked after V > 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>* 0.0015 km, or 0.541695 million km<sup>3</sup>. This ocean water might be from the melting of the two polar ice caps of Earth: Antarctic ice sheet and Artic ice sheet.

Antartic ice sheet covers about 98% of the Antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on Earth, with the average thickness of over 2 km covering an area of almost 14 million km<sup>2</sup>. Its ice volume is 2 km * 14 million km<sup>2</sup>, or 28 mllion km<sup>3</sup>. If the whole mass of the ice sheet is melt, the water mass will be densed by 9%, so the water volume melt from the ice sheet is 28 million km<sup>3</sup> * 0.91, or 25.48 million km<sup>3</sup>, which can increase the mean sea level by 25.48 million km<sup>3</sup>/361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>, or 0.0705 km, or 70.55 meters, greater than another etimate (58 meters of sea level rise if all the ice were above sea level).
