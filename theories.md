City Sinking Theory 

Let A is a city where the land is 1.5 m above mean sea level (MSL) and remains the Earth's crust above mean sea level. The city will be sinked by seawater if the current mean sea level will have increased by 1.5 m, or after the volume of raising water in the global ocean (v) will have been equal to or greater than the global ocean's surface area (O) multiplied by 0.0015 km.

We know that the global or world ocean's surface area is 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>. So, the city will be sinked after V >= 361.13 million km<sup>2</sup>* 0.0015 km, or 0.541695 million km<sup>3</sup>. This ocean water might be from the melting of the two polar ice caps of Earth: Antarctic ice sheet and Artic ice sheet.

Antartic ice sheet covers about 98% of the Antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on Earth, with the average thickness of over 2 km covering an area of almost 14 million km<sup>2</sup>. Its ice volume is 2 km * 14 million km<sup>2</sup>, or 28 mllion km<sup>2</sup>.
