# chatBot
This is a prototype [chatbot of MNRE Service Link Center](https://kietpawpan.github.io/chatBot/). 
This bot can

- track the progress of request submission with [e-Tracking](https://kietpawpan.github.io/chatBot/iTracking.html)
- answer questions about MNRE services with [e-FAQ](https://kietpawpan.github.io/chatBot/FAQ.html)
- get a requestion for MNRE information from people with [e-Request](https://kietpawpan.github.io/chatBot/infoRequest.html)

__Algorithm:__
```
// Create the form UI, with input boxes, an output textarea, and two buttons.
// Get values from each input and format them as an eMail text.
// Allow the user to copy the output text and to paste it in his or her eMail UI.

```
